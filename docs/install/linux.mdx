# Build From Source on Linux

## Prerequisites

In order to compile PcapPlusPlus on Linux please make sure you have the following components installed:

1. **libpcap developers pack** - contains the libpcap library PcapPlusPlus is linking with and relevant the header files. You can download it from <http://www.tcpdump.org/#latest-release> or through the standard Linux package managers such as `apt-get` or `yum`:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install libpcap-dev
   ```

   or:

   ```bash
   sudo yum install libpcap-devel
   ```

2. `libstdc++-static` package. If it's not already installed you can install it using `apt-get` or `yum`

3. **OPTIONAL** - download and install [Zstd](https://github.com/facebook/zstd/releases/latest) if you wish to enable [PCAPNG streaming compression support](../features#readingwriting-pcapng-files-with-compression)

## Configuration

Run the configuration script from PcapPlusPlus main directory:

```bash
./configure-linux.sh
```

Ths script has two modes of operation:

- Wizard mode - the script will walk you through the configuration parameters to provide
- Params mode - provide the different parameters using command-line switches

In general there are several types of configuration:

- With libpcap only
- With DPDK
- With PF_RING

Let's cover the different options. We'll begin with the wizard mode and later cover the params mode.

### Wizard mode

This mode is pretty much self explanatory and the wizard will guide you through the parameters you need to provide:

```shell
seladb@seladb:~/PcapPlusPlus$ ./configure-linux.sh

****************************************
PcapPlusPlus Linux configuration script
****************************************

Number of arguments: 0

Compile PcapPlusPlus with PF_RING? y
Enter PF_RING source path: /home/seladb/PF_RING
Compile PcapPlusPlus with DPDK? y
Enter DPDK source path: /home/seladb/dpdk-18.11
PcapPlusPlus configuration is complete. Files created (or modified): mk/platform.mk, mk/PcapPlusPlus.mk, mk/install.sh, mk/uninstall.sh

seladb@seladb:~/PcapPlusPlus$
```

### Command-line switches mode

You an view all available switches by running `./configure-linux.sh --help` or `./configure-linux.sh -h`:

| Option                        | Description                                                                                                                                        |
| :---------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`--default`**               | use the default configuration. This assumes `libpcap-dev` is installed                                                                             |
| **`--dpdk`**                  | setup PcapPlusPlus with DPDK. When using this switch you must also set **`--dpdk-home`**                                                           |
| **`--dpdk-home`**             | set DPDK home directory. Use only when **`--dpdk`** is set                                                                                         |
| **`--pf-ring`**               | setup PcapPlusPlus with PF_RING. When using this switch you must also set **`--pf-ring-home`**                                                     |
| **`--pf-ring-home`**          | sets PF_RING home directory. Use only when **`--pf-ring`** is set                                                                                  |
| **`--use-immediate-mode`**    | use libpcap immediate mode which enables getting packets as fast as possible (supported on libpcap>=1.5)                                           |
| **`--set-direction-enabled`** | set direction for capturing incoming or outgoing packets (supported on libpcap>=0.9.1)                                                             |
| **`--install-dir`**           | set a custom installation directory. Default is `/usr/local`                                                                                       |
| **`--libpcap-include-dir`**   | libpcap header files directory. This parameter is optional and if omitted PcapPlusPlus will look for the header files in the default include paths |
| **`--libpcap-lib-dir`**       | libpcap pre compiled lib directory. This parameter is optional and if omitted PcapPlusPlus will look for the lib file in the default lib paths     |
| **`--use-zstd`**              | use [Zstd for PCAPNG streaming compression](../features#readingwriting-pcapng-files-with-compression). This parameter is optional                  |
| **`--musl`**                  | Musl base destination platform: i.e. Alpine. This parameter is optional                                                                            |
| **`-h`**, **`--help`**        | displays a help message and exits. No further actions are performed                                                                                |

Here are a few examples:

Default configuration:

```shell
./configure-linux.sh --default
```

Configure PcapPlusPlus with DPDK:

```shell
./configure-linux.sh --dpdk --dpdk-home /home/myuser/dpdk-18.11
```

Configure PcapPlusPlus with PF_RING:

```shell
./configure-linux.sh --pf-ring --pf-ring-home /home/myuser/PF_RING
```

Configure PcapPlusPlus with libpcap's immediate mode:

```shell
./configure-linux.sh --use-immediate-mode
```

Configure PcapPlusPlus with libpcap's set direction:

```shell
./configure-linux.sh --set-direction-enabled
```

Provide non-standard paths for libpcap header and library files:

```shell
./configure-linux.sh --libpcap-include-dir /home/myuser/my-libpcap/include --libpcap-lib-dir /home/myuser/my-libpcap/lib
```

Provide a custom installation directory:

```shell
./configure-linux.sh --install-dir /home/myuser/my-install-dir
```

Use Zstd for pcapng compression:

```shell
./configure-linux.sh --use-zstd
```

## Build the code

After running the config script, you're can safely build the code:

1. Run `make` or `make all` from PcapPlusPlus main directory
2. This should compile all libraries, unit-tests and examples
3. To build the libraries only (without the unit-tests and examples) run `make libs` instead of `make all`
4. After compilation you can find the libraries, examples, header files and helpful makefiles under the `Dist` directory

## Installation

After build is complete you can run the installation script which will copy the library and header files to the installation directory:

```shell
seladb@seladb:~/PcapPlusPlus$ sudo make install
Installation complete!
seladb@seladb:~/PcapPlusPlus$
```

The default installation directory is `/usr/local` which means the header files will be copied to `/usr/local/include/pcapplusplus` and the library files will be copied to `/usr/local/lib`.

You can change the installation directory by using the **`--install-dir`** switch in the configuration script.

## Running tests

PcapPlusPlus contains a set of test-cases you can run to make sure that everything works correctly on your system. [This guide](../tests) contains detailed instructions on how to run them.

## Cross-compilation or build for different architectures

The default architecture that is tested in the CI is `x86-64`. However it's possible to build PcapPlusPlus for other architectures such as `ARM`, `AArch64` (Arm64) or others.
In most cases the only difference is the gcc/g++ compiler used in the build process.
In cross-compilation the compiler may reside in a different folder and may not be the default gcc/g++ compiler installed on the machine.

There is an easy way to use a different gcc/g++ compiler. Let's take an example of cross-compilation to `AArch64` where gcc/g++ resides in
`/usr/bin/`:

```shell
seladb@seladb:/PcapPlusPlus# export CXX=/usr/bin/aarch64-linux-gnu-g++
seladb@seladb:/PcapPlusPlus# export CC=/usr/bin/aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc
seladb@seladb:/PcapPlusPlus# ./configure-linux.sh --default
seladb@seladb:/PcapPlusPlus# make
```
